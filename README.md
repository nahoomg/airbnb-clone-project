- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool for automating testing, building, and deployment processes.

## Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is structured around several key entities to support core functionalities like user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payment processing.

### Users
- **id**: Unique identifier for each user.
- **name**: Full name of the user.
- **email**: Email address used for login and communication.
- **password_hash**: Securely stored password information.
- **role**: Indicates whether the user is a host or a guest.

### Properties
- **id**: Unique identifier for each property.
- **owner_id**: Foreign key referencing the user (host) who owns the property.
- **title**: Name or title of the property listing.
- **description**: Detailed description of the property.
- **location**: Physical address or geographical location of the property.

### Bookings
- **id**: Unique identifier for each booking.
- **property_id**: Foreign key referencing the booked property.
- **user_id**: Foreign key referencing the guest who made the booking.
- **start_date**: Check-in date.
- **end_date**: Check-out date.

### Reviews
- **id**: Unique identifier for each review.
- **property_id**: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property.
- **user_id**: Foreign key referencing the guest who wrote the review.
- **rating**: Numeric score reflecting the userâ€™s satisfaction.
- **comment**: Textual feedback left by the user.

### Payments
- **id**: Unique identifier for each payment transaction.
- **user_id**: Foreign key referencing the guest who made the payment.
- **booking_id**: Foreign key referencing the associated booking.
- **amount**: Total amount paid for the booking.
- **payment_status**: Indicates whether the payment was successful, pending, or failed.

### Entity Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **User** (guest) can make multiple **Bookings**.
- Each **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
- A **Payment** is associated with a **Booking** and the corresponding **User**.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes the following core features to replicate the functionality of a real-world property booking platform:

### User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their personal profiles. Authentication and authorization are handled securely to protect user information and ensure role-based access (guest or host).

### Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. Each listing includes essential details such as title, description, location, pricing, and availability, ensuring an effective booking experience for guests.

### Booking System
Guests can browse available properties, select dates, and make bookings. The booking system ensures that availability is updated in real time to prevent double bookings and manage check-in and check-out logistics.

### Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have booked. This feature helps maintain trust within the platform by providing feedback to hosts and guiding future guests in their selection process.

### Payment Processing
Secure payment handling is integrated to facilitate transactions between guests and hosts. This includes booking payments, refund management, and ensuring that financial data is transmitted securely.

### API Security
The platform implements robust security measures including authentication, authorization, and rate limiting to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the system.

### CI/CD Integration
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment processes. This ensures faster releases, consistent environments, and minimal downtime.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to maintaining the trust, integrity, and functionality of the Airbnb Clone platform. Several key security measures will be implemented:

### Authentication
Authentication verifies the identity of users accessing the platform. It ensures that only registered users can log in and interact with protected resources.

### Authorization
Authorization controls what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform. It ensures that users can only access and modify data that they are permitted to interact with, such as restricting hosts from modifying guest bookings or preventing guests from editing property details.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user or IP address can make to the API within a specified time frame. This measure protects the platform against abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and helps maintain the availability and reliability of services for legitimate users.

### Data Encryption
All sensitive data transmitted between clients and the server will be encrypted using HTTPS. Encrypting data in transit ensures that personal information, payment details, and authentication tokens are protected from interception and unauthorized access.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other code injection attacks.

### Security Importance
Implementing strong security practices is essential for protecting user privacy, securing financial transactions, maintaining system reliability, and preserving the overall reputation and trustworthiness of the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes to the production environment. CI/CD ensures that updates are integrated frequently, tested automatically, and deployed quickly and reliably without manual intervention.

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for maintaining high software quality, reducing deployment risks, and accelerating the development cycle. It helps detect issues early, enforces coding standards, and ensures that every change passes through automated validation before reaching users.

For this project, tools such as **GitHub Actions** can be used to automate tasks like code testing and deployment workflows. **Docker** can be integrated to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.
