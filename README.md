# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview

This project is a collaborative effort to build a simplified clone of the popular lodging marketplace, Airbnb. The goal is to replicate core functionalities such as user management, property listings, search and filtering, and booking capabilities. This project will serve as a practical application of our learning in various software engineering concepts and best practices.

## Project Goals

* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implement secure user registration, login, and session management.
* **Property Management:** Allow users to create, view, update, and delete property listings.
* **Search & Filtering:** Develop robust search functionalities to help users find properties based on various criteria (location, price, amenities, etc.).
* **Booking System:** Enable users to book properties and manage their reservations.
* **Database Integration:** Design and implement an efficient database schema to store project data.
* **API Development:** Create a well-structured RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.
* **User Interface (UI):** Develop a responsive and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
* **Deployment:** Successfully deploy the application to a cloud platform.
